  <h2>EP1000 Digital Fabrication & Prototyping Fundamentals Introduction</h2>
  
  <P>
  This is my page for documentation of the work done in EP1000 Digital Fabrication & Prototyping Fundamentals.
  We will be learning about Introduction, Fablab Safety, Tools, Project Management, Web Development, Computer Aided Design,
  3D Printing, Computer Controlled Cutting, and Embedded Programming.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Lab Safety</h2>
    
    <p>
      There are many things to take note of in the lab. We were shown many examples of how accidents can happen in a workshop with the
      different equipment, if one is not careful. There have been instances in Singapore Polytechnic where a student sustained
      an injury due to carelessness. Therefore, it is important that we abide by the safety rules and look out for one another when
      in the workshop, paying attention to our surroundings at all times and asking for help where appropriate. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
      As a former DNT student, I hope I can at least put some of knowledge picked up
      in my classes to use. Things in the fablab are about the same as in the DNT Workshop; <strong>be careful of the surrounding equipment, read
      the warning signs and pay attention to your surroundings, asking lecturers for help with the more dangerous equipment.</strong> For girls,
      the attire is <strong> tied hair, long pants and covered shoes. </strong>
