<h2> Laser Cutting</h2>

<body>

<p>
	Laser cutter can cut away material and do engraving on it. There is vector cutting and engraving (etching), as well as raster engraving,
	each producing different results. Raster engraving takes a longer time than vector scoring/etching. In general, we use laser cutting
	on cardboard, paper, plywood and acrylic. The laser will burn away material. 

	Applications for laser cutting are varied, and different applications are more suited for different types of rendering. Cutting, marking or engraving is made with raster and vector programmes, screen printing can be done with halftone, holes and path. 
</p>

<p>
There are many softwares that can be used for laser cutting, such as Corel Draw, Gimp, Photoshop and Illustrator. 
	As I will be using Illustrator, an important thing to take note is the <strong>stroke width for a hairline stroke, which is 0.001, used for vector cutting. </strong>
	There are also reccomended settings for laser cutting with different machines and materials. We use RED (R255, G0, B0) and set the line weight to
hairline for vector cutting & Green (R0, G255, B0) for
engraving.

<P>
In SP, the CO2 laser is used. However, there are many types of laser used in the industry, which have different properties and affect how deep they can cut, how they cut. A fiber laser for example, will able to cut deeper than a CO2 laser.
</p>

<p>
Airflow/air assist is very important for safe laser cutting as it prevents fires from starting. We must remember to <strong>turn on the air assist and exhaust pump</strong> when using the laser cutter.

	<h2> Safety </h2>

	<ul> 


	<li>We must always take note of laser safety. Some laser cutters require a license to operate, depending on what class it is. The ones at SP are safe as the laser will be cut off when the lock is opened. </li>

	<li>Cutting certain materials will release poisonous fumes. As a result, we do not cut materials such as PVC, since they release chlorine gas. Make sure that you only cut prohibited materials, always ask if you are unsure. </li>

	<li>It must be operated under supervision at all times. There is a fire hazard as a laser is involved. If you see any fires started along the cuts, stop the operation immediately. </li>
		<li>If there is a fire that does not go out, press the emergency button and lift the cover to stop the laser. Lifting the
		cover will always instantly stop the laser. </li>
<LI>Make sure to turn on both the compressed air and exhaust to ensure that dust and fumes are being removed from the cutting area.</LI>
