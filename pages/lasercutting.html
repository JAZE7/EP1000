In SP, the CO2 laser is used. However, there are many types of laser used in the industry, which have different properties and affect how deep they can cut, how they cut. A fiber laser for example, will able to cut deeper than a CO2 laser.

Airflow/air assist is very important for safe laser cutting as it prevents fires from starting. We must remember to <strong>turn on the air assist and exhaust pump</strong> when using the laser cutter.

	<h2> Safety </h2>

	<ul> 


	<li>We must always take note of laser safety. Some laser cutters require a license to operate, depending on what class it is. The ones at SP are safe as the laser will be cut off when the lock is opened. </li>

	<li>Cutting certain materials will release poisonous fumes. As a result, we do not cut materials such as PVC, since they release chlorine gas. Make sure that you only cut prohibited materials, always ask if you are unsure. </li>

	<li>It must be operated under supervision at all times. There is a fire hazard as a laser is involved. If you see any fires started along the cuts, stop the operation immediately. </li>

</ul>
