	<h2>AUTODESK FUSION 360</h2>


<body>


A free software available for download online. It requires an internet connection. It can render 3D models. Fusion 360 saves the previous versions that you can revert to if you make a mistake, found in the Data Panel on the left. 

<br>
We can use the View Cube to navigate the planes and different axis. 
Complicated designs will have multiple components. 
We usually work in Millimetre but that can be changed. 
<br>
We can use a canvas to trace over for our design. It will end up on the sketch layer which we use to extrude the shapes to make them 3D.
<br>
Design History shows us the steps we took to arrive at our final design. Here, we can also edit the aspects that we want to change at certain points in time, and it updates the final product. 
<br>
Grids can help us layout more easily and enabling ‘Snap to Grid’ is recommended. 
<br>
Generative design is a useful tool to help us generate more complex designs.  

<p>

	We tried the software out, with 3 exercises:

		We can use lines to construct our drawing and use the trim tool to remove the excess if needed. We can also convert lines to construction lines if we no longer need them. The construction lines are shown as dotted lines. 
	Blue lines are non-constrained lines, which can be moved. If we want them to stay, we can add dimensions to lock it in place.

	<h2> 2D & 3D Drawing </h2>
</head>

<body>

There are several softwares we can use to draw 2D & 3D raster and vectors, such as GIMP, Photoshop, Illustrator, 
<br>
We can use GIMP or Photoshop to resize an image, remove the background, add a border, etc. 
<br>
As I already have Photoshop installed, I will be using it. 
<br>

<h3>Photoshop exercise</h3>
I used Photoshop to remove the background of this image:

<br>
Using the same file, I added a seaside background:
