	<h2>AUTODESK FUSION 360</h2>


<body>


A free software available for download online. It requires an internet connection. It can render 3D models. Fusion 360 saves the previous versions that you can revert to if you make a mistake, found in the Data Panel on the left. 

	<P>
<br>
We can use the View Cube to navigate the planes and different axis. 
Complicated designs will have multiple components. 
We usually work in Millimetre but that can be changed. 
<br>
We can use a canvas to trace over for our design. It will end up on the sketch layer which we use to extrude the shapes to make them 3D.
<br>
Design History shows us the steps we took to arrive at our final design. Here, we can also edit the aspects that we want to change at certain points in time, and it updates the final product. 
<br>
Grids can help us layout more easily and enabling ‘Snap to Grid’ is recommended. 
<br>
	Dimensions can be added using the shortcut "D" and clicking on the part where you want to add a dimension.
	<br>
	After we are done with the sketch, we click "Stop Sketch".
	<br>
Generative design is a useful tool to help us generate more complex designs. 
		
		Mirroring can be used for planes and solids to duplicate them in Fusion 360.
		The solid should be selected before duplicating so that the whole thing will be duplicated.
		
		<br>
		Offset plane can be used to create a plane floating above another, so we can sketch on it. 
	</P>

	We tried the software out, with 3 exercises:

	<p>
		
		We can use lines to construct our drawing and use the trim tool to remove the excess if needed. We can also convert lines to construction lines if we no longer need them. The construction lines are shown as dotted lines. 
	Blue lines are non-constrained lines, which can be moved. If we want them to stay, we can add dimensions to lock it in place.

	<h2> 2D & 3D Drawing </h2>
</head>

<body>

	<p>
There are several softwares we can use to draw 2D & 3D raster and vectors, such as GIMP, Photoshop, Illustrator, 
<br>
We can use GIMP or Photoshop to resize an image, remove the background, add a border, etc. 
<br>
As I already have Photoshop installed, I will be using it. 
<br>
		
	</p>

<h3>Photoshop exercise</h3>
	
	<p>
I used Photoshop to remove the background of this image:
<img src=pics/original.jpg width="600">
	I used the Quick Selection tool to select the boat and refined the edges using the tools in the masking mode. Then,
	I toggled the sliders to feather the edges slightly and increased the contrast so that the image would still be sharp. I changed the 
	result to Create New Layer with Mask. After masking the boat, I placed the seaside background image behind it (found on google), and edited the
	colours for both images so that they would match more. 
<br>
(Using the same file, I added a seaside background):

	<h3>Nametag Exercise</h3>
	
	<p>
		I made a nametag in Fusion 360, using a different design from the example shown in class.
		The width of the nametag is 60mm, height 30mm, with an offset of 2mm for the border.
		<br>
		<img src=pics/nametop.png width="600">
		<br>
		<img src=pics/nameiso.png width="600">
		<br>
		I used glossy blue plastic for the text and borders, translucent matte white plastic for
		the rest of the body, under Appearance. 
		
		
	</p>
	Finished product:

	<h3>Fidget Spinner Exercise</h3>
	
	<p>
		I made a fidget spinner in Fusion 360, following the design shown in class.
		
		
		
	</p>
	
	
<h3>Bowl Using LOFT feature</h3>
	
	

<h3>Chess Piece Exercise</h3>
	
	<P>
	The profile should be made by extrusion. The base should be made by revolving. 
	The chess piece I decided to make was the knight (horse head).
	Photo reference used to trace for the sketch is taken from google.
	
	<br>
	
	<Ol>
		<li>Make a sketch on the FRONT plane, for the horse head. </li>
		<li>Trace the image from google of the head until it is closed (profile). </li>
		<li>Extrude the shape.</li>
		<li>Trace half of the base and close it in the center.</li>
		<li>Select it and revolve to make the base. </li>
		
		</ol>
