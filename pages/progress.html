	<h1> Progress on Project</h1>
</head>

Here are some ideas I have in mind for now for my project:

<ol>

	<li>-timed coffee warmer
<br>
(base will heat up & can be controlled or turned off with control panel) 
<br>
keep drink at a certain temperature until user is ready to drink
<br>
How Arduino can be incorporated: Temperature sensor required to regulate the temperature of the drink and heat up the base. 
<br>
Pain point/reason for product: Parents drink coffee every day and sometimes it gets cold because they are distracted and wait too long.

</li>

<li>rotating computer stand
<br>
Computer stand that can rotate and be locked into place (when facing forward). Additional: can reset to face forward with the push of a button. 
	<br>
How Arduino can be incorporated: top part can rotate back (reset to front) with the push of a button. 
<br>
Pain point/reason for product: Due to the length of my Macbook charger cable and placement of the power socket, I use my computer to charge my phone. Sometimes I will pull on the cable to use my phone while sitting on my bed which causes the computer to rotate on its makeshift stand. If I am careless and pull too hard, the computer falls onto the table.
