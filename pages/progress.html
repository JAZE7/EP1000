	<h1> Progress on Project</h1>
</head>

Here are some ideas I have in mind for now for my project:

<ol>

	<li>-Timed Coffee Warmer
<br>
(base will heat up & can be controlled or turned off with control panel) 
<br>
keep drink at a certain temperature until user is ready to drink
<br>
How Arduino can be incorporated: Temperature sensor required to regulate the temperature of the drink and heat up the base. 
<br>
Pain point/reason for product: Parents drink coffee every day and sometimes it gets cold because they are distracted and wait too long. 
<br>

</li>

<li>Rotating Computer Stand
<br>
Computer stand that can rotate and be locked into place (when facing forward). Additional: can reset to face forward with the push of a button. 
	<br>
How Arduino can be incorporated: top part can rotate back (reset to front) with the push of a button. 
<br>
Pain point/reason for product: Due to the length of my Macbook charger cable and placement of the power socket, I use my computer to charge my phone. Sometimes I will pull on the cable to use my phone while sitting on my bed which causes the computer to rotate on its makeshift stand. If I am careless and pull too hard, the computer falls onto the table.

		<h1> Week One</h1>

<h1> Decision for Project</h1>

<p>
	Mr Dorville provided a list of sample projects we could use and modify and I was interested in the PlexiCLock, Timelapse Motor and Volume Control Knob in particular. I decided to choose the volume control knob as it was my favorite and simpler compared to the other two. The components are also easier to obtain.
</p>

<p>
	
		<h3>Some variations of the volume control:</h3>

<ul>

	<li><a href="https://blog.prusaprinters.org/3d-print-an-oversized-media-control-volume-knob-arduino-basics_30184/">Oversized Volume Control Knob</a> </li>

	<li><a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Vintage-Rotary-Phone-Dial-PC-Volume-Control/">Vintage Rotary Phone Dial Themed Volume Control</a> (they used a real phone dial as part of the design) </li>

	<li><a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/USB-Volume-Knob/">Modern Design</a> </li>

</ul>
	</p>

	<h1>Project Name: Sound Control Knob </h1>

	
<P>
I have decided to make a combination of the volume knob that Mr Dorville found
	(as it includes steps for the user to have a sense of the scale, allows you to skip and pause songs by clicking), and the modern version's design, with a sleek look. 
</P>

	
<h2>Bill of Materials</h2>

<ul>

<li>1 x Rotary encoder (check)</li>

<li>1 x Arduino Pro Micro/Arduino Leonardo (check?)</li>

</ul>


<h2>Sketch</h2>

<P>


Instead of doing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oe0f7288Enw">knurl surface</a> on the side of the knob, I will make grooves for the fingers on
	the sides.
