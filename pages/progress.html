	<h1> Progress on Project</h1>
</head>

Here are some ideas I have in mind for now for my project:

<ol>

	<li>-Timed Coffee Warmer
<br>
(base will heat up & can be controlled or turned off with control panel) 
<br>
keep drink at a certain temperature until user is ready to drink
<br>
How Arduino can be incorporated: Temperature sensor required to regulate the temperature of the drink and heat up the base. 
<br>
Pain point/reason for product: Parents drink coffee every day and sometimes it gets cold because they are distracted and wait too long. 
<br>

</li>

<li>Rotating Computer Stand
<br>
Computer stand that can rotate and be locked into place (when facing forward). Additional: can reset to face forward with the push of a button. 
	<br>
How Arduino can be incorporated: top part can rotate back (reset to front) with the push of a button. 
<br>
Pain point/reason for product: Due to the length of my Macbook charger cable and placement of the power socket, I use my computer to charge my phone. Sometimes I will pull on the cable to use my phone while sitting on my bed which causes the computer to rotate on its makeshift stand. If I am careless and pull too hard, the computer falls onto the table.

		<h1> Week One</h1>

<h1> Decision for Project</h1>

<p>
	Mr Dorville provided a list of sample projects we could use and modify and I was interested in the PlexiCLock, Timelapse Motor and Volume Control Knob in particular. I decided to choose the volume control knob as it was my favorite and simpler compared to the other two. The components are also easier to obtain.
</p>

<p>
	
		<h3>Some variations of the volume control:</h3>

<ul>

	<li><a href="https://blog.prusaprinters.org/3d-print-an-oversized-media-control-volume-knob-arduino-basics_30184/">Oversized Volume Control Knob</a> </li>

	<li><a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Vintage-Rotary-Phone-Dial-PC-Volume-Control/">Vintage Rotary Phone Dial Themed Volume Control</a> (they used a real phone dial as part of the design) </li>

	<li><a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/USB-Volume-Knob/">Modern Design</a> </li>

</ul>
	</p>

	<h1>Project Name: Sound Control Knob </h1>

	
<P>
I have decided to make a combination of the volume knob that Mr Dorville found
	(as it includes steps for the user to have a sense of the scale, allows you to skip and pause songs by clicking), and the modern version's design, with a sleek look. 
</P>

	
<h2>Bill of Materials Draft</h2>

<ul>

<li>1 x Rotary encoder (check), using b10k rotary potentiometer. </li>

<li>1 x Arduino Pro Micro/Arduino Leonardo (check?), using Arduino Uno. </li>

</ul>


<h2>Initial Sketch</h2>

Outer Casing:

<P>


Instead of doing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oe0f7288Enw">knurl surface</a> on the side of the knob, I will make grooves for the fingers on
	the sides. 
	
	</P>
	
	<h2>Developed Version:</h2>
		
		<p>
After consulting my lecturer, here are the improvements and changes made: 
		<br>
		The case will be made using laser cutting, with the "flexture laser cut box" method that allows a flat piece to be bent into a curved wall. 
			
		There are many <a href="http://ideate.xsead.cmu.edu/gallery/projects/project-proposal-patterns-to-laser-cut-flexible-wood">designs and patterns</a> for the flexible hinge. This adds to the aesthetic and checks the requirement of including a laser cut component in my project.
			The lid and base will also be made using laser cutting. I have also added some spaces for the wires and components. 
		</P>

		</p>


<p>
	Instead of using the b10k rotary potentiometer provided in the kit, I will be using a rotary encoder kindly provided by my lecturer, as it has more
	capabilities such as the push button switch that will allow me to make the controller pause and play the music when the button is pressed. 
	
	<br>
	For the wood, there are a few different thickness available in the lab: 2.5mm, 3mm, 4mm, and 5mm. I will be using 2.5mm so that the curve will 
	have a lower risk of breaking. 
</P>

		<h2>Bill of Materials Final</h2>

<ul>

<li>1 x Rotary encoder (check),  </li>

<li>1 x Arduino Pro Micro/Arduino Leonardo </li>
	
	<li>Plywood (2.5mm)</li>
	
	<li>Filament for 3D printer</li>


</ul>

<h2>Flexture Design</h2>

<p>
For the flexible laser cut part, I will be using the design from this website <a href="https://www.etsy.com/sg-en/listing/515495692/new-patterns-flexible-laser-cut-bracelet?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=lasercut+files&ref=sr_gallery-1-10">(lasercut flexible bracelet)</a> as reference and modifying it to my liking. 
</P>

<h2>Arduino attempts</h2>

<P>
	For the volume control knob programming,
	I tried linking up the arduino board to the rotary encoder, and using the codes provided by several websites to programme it. 
	Although I tried different codes from different websites, they didnâ€™t work because I was using the Arduino Uno CDC, while 
	the boards used in the tutorials online were the Pro Micro and Nano. I received error messages telling me that HID is needed for volume control.
	For codes which I successfully uploaded onto the board, no output was given when testing it. I even tried plugging it into a Windows computer, but to no avail. 
	I also checked with my dad and he confirmed that HID is needed for volume control, saying that I needed to change the board. Thankfully, my lecturer assured me that amongst the two alternatives (Arduino Pro Micro (ATMega32U4) or the Digispark (ATTiny85)), the Digispark was available at FABLAB.
