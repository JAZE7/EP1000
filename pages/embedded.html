  <h2> Embedded Programming with Arduino </h2>


<p>
We learnt about the various components that can be used in a circuit, such as types of switches which control the flow of current, diodes which can light up when current passes through them, and a transistor which is activated when current flows through.

As I have taken DNT as one of my O-level subjects, many of these were familiar to me.

<h2> Arduino </h2>

<p>
<a href= "https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> is not the board but the entire system, including the grid, UNO board, and programming. It can be used in many ways to create robots and for projects. 
</p>

<p>
<a href= "https://www.tinkercad.com/">Tinkercad</a> is the website we will be using to learn it, where we can simulate a circuit to practice before using Arduino. Running a simulation has many uses. We can calculate the voltage, different scenarios and experiment with the different components to see if it works before trying it out on a real circuit. We can even see how the code looks like. 
</p>

   My first attempt with Tinkercad was a fail because I didn't realise that I was on the 3D Designs workspace instead of the circuit workspace
    which allows you to do simulations of a circuit. I was wondering why I wasn't able to connect wires from the components and it was because that
    can only be done in the circuit simulation workspace, which looks similar to the 3D Designs'.

    3D Designs workspace:

    Circuits workspace:
    <br>
    <img src= "../pics/circuits.png" height = "400px" >
    
<p>
  Once I switched to the circuit workspace, I was able to connect the components with wires and play around with
  the circuit. </p>
