  <h2> Embedded Programming with Arduino </h2>


<p>
We learnt about the various components that can be used in a circuit, such as types of switches which control the flow of current, diodes which can light up when current passes through them, and 

As I have taken DNT as one of my O-level subjects, many of these were familiar to me.

<h2> Arduino </h2>

<p>
<a href= "https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> is not the board but the entire system, including the grid, UNO board, and programming. It can be used in many ways to create robots and for projects. 
</p>

<p>
<a href= "https://www.tinkercad.com/">Tinkercad</a> is the website we will be using to learn it, where we can simulate a circuit to practice before using Arduino. Running a simulation has many uses. We can calculate the voltage, different scenarios and experiment with the different components to see if it works before trying it out on a real circuit. We can even see how the code looks like.
