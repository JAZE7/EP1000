	<p>
	Using Github to host your site is useful as it allows you to save different versions (have version control) so if you make a mistake
	want to revert to a previous version (or a period in history), you can revert any time and have the rest of the versions still saved.
	Many people can also access your site and work on the project at the same time. They can also see what and how you have made certain things
	by accessing the repository. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		We made our own accounts and created our site on Github, using our own public repository and text documents made
		on text editors such as Sublime Text. We imported the html files and photos using folders to separate them, and linked
		the files to the main page. Each time a change is made and saved, that is a new version that we can go back to if needed.
		Everything will be saved on Github as a version. 
	
	<h2>Git</h2>
	
	<p>
	Git can be downloaded onto our desktop for Mac and Windows. For big projects with multiple people working on them, Git can be used
	for each person to make changes and tests on their own before pushing it onto the site. After downloading and signing up using email,
	we can make changes to our files and commits, before pushing them onto the main site. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	A branch can be created if you want to test out something and make changes to many areas, but do not want to affect the things other people
	are working on. The main branch that everyone uploads to is called the Master branch. If you do not want to make changes on it, you can
	create a branch and work on that, without changing or affecting the master branch.
